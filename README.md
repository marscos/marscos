I'm Marcos, a passionate software developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [UFMG](https://www.ufmg.br/) and an IT Technician degree from [CEFET-MG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Center_for_Technological_Education_of_Minas_Gerais) with a few years of professional experience. I love building thoughtful, user-friendly solutions. I have experience across multiple frameworks, languages, and domains, and am always eager to learn about cutting-edge tech.

### ðŸ’¼ Recent Professional Experience

- **[Banco do Brasil](https://www.bb.com.br/)** : I architected and built ETL workloads and AI models for quantitative finance and credit analysis using Apache Spark in a Hadoop ecosystem. Understanding business needs and fostering a data-driven culture was just as important.
- **[SYDLE](https://www.sydle.com/)**: Led the development of the content-driven website [Melhores.com](https://melhores.com) using [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) and a headless CMS, focusing on SEO and performance. Contributed as a mantainer to the holding's Web Components package. Also worked on marketing tools and SPAs using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) and much more.

### ðŸŒŸ A Few of My Public Repositories

- **[Hekate](https://github.com/marscos/hekate-app) ðŸ›  (WIP)**: A [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) web app for DJs that represents music collections as graphs in order to identify compatible tracks for mixing.
- **[Imouto Bot](https://github.com/marscos/imouto_bot)**: A Telegram bot that uses [AniList's GraphQL API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/) to provide anime/manga search results via inline queries. Built with simplicity, ease of deployment and scalability in mind, currently hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Type a message starting with `@imouto_bot` to try it out!
- **[Data Mapper](https://github.com/marscos/data-mapper)**: A simple React app capable of mapping data from an input JSON and static values to an output object that follows the Amazon Partner Network (APN) Customer Engagements (ACE) data schema, through a [TanStack Form](https://tanstack.com/form/latest) form that supports [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) expressions and output validation using [Zod V4](https://zod.dev/), along with components built on top of [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
- **[Tabs](https://github.com/marscos/tabs)**: A demo offline React app to help keep track of bar, restaurant, poker and similar tabs, in order to split bills more easily. It is designed for quick, local use â€” no backend or account required. Currently using Redux for state management.
