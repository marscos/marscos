# üëã Hey! 

I'm Marcos, a passionate software developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [UFMG](https://www.ufmg.br/), an IT Technician degree from [CEFET-MG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Center_for_Technological_Education_of_Minas_Gerais) and over 4 years of professional experience. I specialize in building thoughtful, user-friendly web applications and architecting data-driven solutions. My expertise spans across multiple frameworks, languages, and domains, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies.

## üíº Recent Professional Experience
